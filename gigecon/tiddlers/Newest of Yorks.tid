New York, yassified. 
This city is unique in the fact that it has no buildings on the land. All itâ€™s buildings are in the sky. These tall buildings are accessible by [[Skyways]] that whisk pedestrians to and fro. 
The land is used for agriculture, divided into plots and claimed by the biggest companies in the state.
